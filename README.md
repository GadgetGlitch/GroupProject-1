# Assignment Tracker

## Team Members: Pradeesh, Annaka, and Mike K. 

## Description: 

Each semester students have many classes, this means many assignments and deadlines. Online students who live out of the schoolsâ€™ time zone have the extra burden of converting time zones for each assignment. In order to keep track of many tables and checkbox tools have to be reprogrammed every semester. This proves to be a tedious task and adds in human errors from data entry. The project aims to address this issue by means of a simple Assignment Tracker program.

The program reads a csv file that contains details such as Assignment title, assignment description, due date provided by the school, school time zone and completion status. The data is presented in the form of a table with upcoming assignments displayed in the top rows and completed assginments marked in red font and shifted to the bottom rows. The table gets updated whenever a user marks an assignment as complete. 

The program is released under the Blended Open Software License - Version 1.0. Details can be found in the License.md file.

Detailed instructions for the installations required to run the program can be found in the Installation.md file.

Step by step instructions for running the program is available in the User Document.md file
