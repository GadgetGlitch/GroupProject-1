Assignment Tracker
Team Members: Pradeesh, Annaka, and Mike K. 
Description: 
Each semester students have many classes, this means many assignments and deadlines. Online students who live out of the schoolsâ€™ time zone have the extra burden of converting time zones for each assignment. In order to keep track of many tables and checkbox tools have to be reprogrammed every semester. This proves to be a tedious task and adds in human errors from data entry. The project aims to address this issue by means of a simple Assignment Tracker program.
