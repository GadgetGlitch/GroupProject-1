Assignment Tracker

Team Members: Pradeesh, Annaka, and Mike K. 

Description: 

Each semester students have many classes, this means many assignments and deadlines. Online students who live out of the schoolsâ€™ time zone have the extra burden of converting time zones for each assignment. In order to keep track of many tables and checkbox tools have to be reprogrammed every semester. This proves to be a tedious task and adds in human errors from data entry. The project aims to address this issue by means of a simple Assignment Tracker program.
Our anticipated challenges and collab plan: 

Anticipated Challenges:

Technical: Basic Feature item #1 lists being able to feed the tool a csv file due to lack of technical exposure to know-how over webscraping for webpage data i.e. Canvas. Getting this information into a csv or text file is a challenge. File converting comes with many data transferring issues. Getting a table of data may require manual data entry which can override the need for the tool in the first place.  

Process: Understanding the process that could work versus the processes that work the best might take some time. Researching different ways to do the same thing can lead to time delays.

Team: The team is novice at programming, coding, and this challenges the finished project's smoothness and fluidity of use.

Collaboration Plan:

Annaka, Mike and Pradeesh plan to communicate through WhatsApp, Zoom, and Canvas. The maximum time zone difference between the members is 13 and half hours. The team will meet on Zoom adaptively as the project demands. The team will work collaboratively on all aspects of the project.
