This project is designed for the platform Jupyter Notebook in the language of Python. 
There are several packages that are needed to be installed and imported before the notbook will run.

## Introduction
This document provides detailed instructions for installing and setting up the Assignment Tracker
on your system. It covers the installation process, including prerequisites, step-by-step setup instructions, 
and verification of a successful installation. 

## Prerequisites
- A computer with internet access.
- Python 3.9 or newer installed.
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.
- Basic familiarity with running Jupyter Notebooks.

## Preparation
1. Ensure Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed on your system. Visit [Python's official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
and [Jupyter's installation guide](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions.
2. Download the repository and open Assignment Tracker notebook file from this repository. Sample data (csv) file is provided in Datasets folder of this repository. 

## Dependencies
Before running the Assignment Tracker, ensure you have reviewed the requirements.txt file and have installed all the packages and libraries listed in the file. These dependencies are crucial for the functionality.

## Command Line Installation Process
1. Open your terminal (or Command Prompt/PowerShell in Windows).
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab by typing `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` and pressing Enter. If you are using Anaconda installation, then a link to launch Jupyter Notebook will already be available in the program menu.

## Configuration and Setup
1. In the Jupyter interface, locate and open the Assignment Tracker notebook.
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook.

## Verification
Ensure that the notebook runs without errors:
1. Try executing all cells (In Jupyter Notebook, you can use the "Run All" feature under the "Cell" menu). Note that one of the cells will ask the user to input the name of their city. Subsequent cells of the notebook can be run only after user provides this input.

## Troubleshooting
- **Issue:** Jupyter Notebook does not launch.
  - **Solution:** Check that Python and Jupyter are correctly installed and accessible from your command line or terminal.
- **Issue:** Errors when running the notebook.
  - **Solution:** Ensure all required Python packages are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
